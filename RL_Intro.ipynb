    "<p>Now that we have this taken care of, we can begin  with a brief introduction to one subset of Reinforcement Learning methods: Policy based methods. Policy based methods allow us to make our agent improve its performance by determining which policies for acting produce better results. This is different from more state based methods referred to as Q learning methods. <a href=\"https://flyyufelix.github.io/2017/10/12/dqn-vs-pg.html\">This writeup</a> provides a relatively concise comparision of the two methods, but in short: policy methods seek to act optimally while Q learning methods seek to reach optimal states. Both methods may be used to make an intelligent agent, but for the examples we are working with here, our actions and state space are more continuos than discrete.</p>"
